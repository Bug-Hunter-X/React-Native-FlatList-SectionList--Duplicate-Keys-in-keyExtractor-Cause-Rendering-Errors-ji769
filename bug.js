In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an unusual error can occur if you don't handle the keyExtractor prop correctly.  If the keyExtractor function returns a duplicate key for different items in your data, the component will not render correctly and might show unexpected behavior, such as items disappearing or being duplicated. The error message may be cryptic, leading to difficulty in debugging.  For example, if you're using an object and your keyExtractor is `({item}) => item.id` but the `id` property is missing or not unique, problems occur.

```javascript
// Incorrect keyExtractor
<FlatList
  data={[{name: 'Item 1', id: 1}, {name: 'Item 2', id: 1}]} // Duplicate ID
  keyExtractor={({item}) => item.id}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```
